Well, well, well, Mr Tannen. How nice to see you here. DOC! THE RED LOG'S ABOUT TO BLOW!!! Clara!! Whoa!! Emmett! Thanks, Biff.  Jennifer. Jen. Jennifer. Wake up.  My horse threw his shoe. Seein' you was the one who done the shoeing, I figures you was responsible. Well since you never paid me for the job I say that makes us even! Wrong! See I was on my horse when he threw his shoe and I got throwed off. And that just caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky Redeye. So the way I figure, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey, and seventy-five dollars for the horse. That's eighty dollars! Look, if your horse threw his shoe, bring him back and I'll re-shoe him!</p>
